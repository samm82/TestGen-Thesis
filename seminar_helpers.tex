\def\litStd{If the field of software engineering holds code to a high standard
    in terms of clarity, consistency, and robustness, then the literature that
    supports code development should be held to this same standard!}

\def\badTaxonomies{Unfortunately, a search for a systematic, rigorous, and
    complete taxonomy for software testing revealed that the existing ones are
    inadequate and incomplete:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ifnotpaper\else Tebes et al. \fi\citet{TebesEtAl2020a} focus on
              \emph{parts} of the testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity),
        \item \ifnotpaper\else Souza et al. \fi\citet{SouzaEtAl2017} prioritize
              organizing testing approaches over defining them, and
        \item \ifnotpaper\else Unterkalmsteiner et al. \fi\citet{UnterkalmsteinerEtAl2014}
              focus on the ``information linkage or transfer'' \citetext{p.~A:6}
              between requirements engineering and software testing.
