Name,Definition,Precedence for Test Approach,Notes
Accountability?,"The ""capability of a product to enable actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to the entity"" (ISO/IEC, 2023a)",,
Accuracy,"A ""qualitative assessment of correctness"" or ""quantitative measure of the magnitude of error"" (IEEE, 2013, p. 7)",,
Adaptability,"The ""capability of a product to be effectively and efficiently adapted for or transferred to different hardware, software or other operational or usage environments"" (ISO/IEC, 2023a)",,"Related to flexibility (IEEE, 2017, p. 12; implied by ISO/IEC, 2023a). Accessibility can improve this (and flexibility) (ISO/IEC, 2023a)"
"Analyzability (IEEE, 2017, p. 18) or Analysability (ISO/IEC 2023a)","The ""capability of a product to be effectively and efficiently assessed regarding the impact of an intended change to … its parts, to diagnose it for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified"" (ISO/IEC 2023a)",,"Related to modifiability (IEEE, 2017, p. 18)"
Authenticity,"The ""capability of a product to prove that the identity of a subject or resource is the one claimed"" (ISO/IEC 2023a)",,
Availability,"The ""ability of a service or service component to perform its required function at an agreed instant or over an agreed period of time"" (IEEE, 2017, p. 38)",,"""Normally expressed as a ratio or percentage"" (IEEE, 2017, p. 38). Related to error tolerance, fault tolerance, reliability, and robustness (IEEE, 2017, p. 38)"

Comfort,,,"e.g., screen brightness"
Complexity,,,A quality that software shouldn't have
Conciseness,,,
Concurrency,,,
Conformance,,"Washizaki, 2024, p. 5-7","Synonym for ""correctness""? Related to functional testing (Washizaki, 2024, p. 5-7). May refer to the process level, not the software level"

"Continuity (Washizaki, 2024, p. 6-7)",,,
Correctability,,,Related to maintainability?
Correctness,,"Washizaki, 2024, p. 5-7","Synonym for ""conformance""? Related to functional testing (Washizaki, 2024, p. 5-7)"
Coupling,,,
Criticality,,,
Efficiency,,"""Performance efficiency testing"" mentioned in IEEE (2022, p. 9; 2017, pp. 58, 159, 253, 442, 508)",
Error Tolerance,,,
Expandability,,,
Extendability,,,
"Service Availability (Washizaki, 2024, p. 6-7)",,,Related to availability? A subset?
