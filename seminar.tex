    \framesubtitle{What is Drasil?}
    My project was originally focused on Drasil, "a framework for generating
    all of the software artifacts from a stable knowledge base, focusing
    currently on scientific software" \cite{HuntEtAl2021}
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{columns}[T,onlytextwidth]

            \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item<2-> I worked on Drasil as an Undergraduate Summer
                          Research Assistant during the summers of 2018 and 2019
                          % \item<2-> Knowledge is introduced either at a global level
                          %     or at an example-specific level
                    \item<3-> ``Recipes'' specify how information from the
                          knowledge based is used to generate
                          software artifacts, including:
                          \begin{itemize}
                              \item SRS (HTML, PDF, Markdown)
                              \item Code (Python, Java, C\#, C++, Swift, Julia)
                              \item READMEs and Makefiles
                              \item Drasil's own website\footnotemark[1]!
                          \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item My project was originally going to be implementing
              test case generation in Drasil
        \item<2-> The rough workflow:
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \item<2-> Implement manual testing \\
                        Manual unit tests (26 \textcolor{green}{passed},
                        18 \textcolor{orange}{failed with known reason}) \\
                        Manual system tests (3 \textcolor{green}{passed},
                        4 \textcolor{orange}{failed with known reason})
                  \item<3-> Understand the {\only<5->{\color{red}}stable
                                knowledge base} to create new ``recipes''
                  \item<4-> Generate test cases!
              \end{enumerate}
        \item<5-> There was a big assumption in this plan that drastically
              changed my project

\section{Project}
\subsection{Drasil}

% \begin{frame}
%     \frametitle{Drasil}
%     \framesubtitle{"Generate All The Things!"}
%     % TODO: "Generate All The Things!" is a beautifully appropriate tagline for Drasil
%     %       for a few reasons:
%     %                  1. What are "Things"? One may only think of "Things" as far as their knowledge and understanding allows them! You wouldn't be able to think of things without some sort of basis/constructive understanding/methodology to _get_ there, you can't _think of random phenomena_ (that's why they're phenomena).

%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item<2-> An exploration in software-related artifact generation for "well understood" domains \cite{KnowledgeCapture2021} through strong knowledge capture.
%             \begin{itemize}
%                 \item<3-> By unifying knowledge into a single framework with reusable composable units of knowledge, we eliminate code duplication, formally impose traceability and maintainability of knowledge (and software), and allow for easy knowledge transference.
%                 \item<4-> Knowledge organization and capture is of utmost importance, as it is the pathway for interpreters and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to make appropriate usage of the knowledge captured.
%                 \item<5-> By creating different kinds of "printers", we can use a stable knowledge-base to generate software that solves "well understood" problems.
%             \end{itemize}
%         \item<6-> Drasil currently focuses on building research software, generating Software Requirement Specification documents (SRS) in both LaTeX and HTML (with MathJaX), code to solve a problem, README files, Makefiles, graphs, etc.
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Problem Statement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Currently, there is no way to verify Drasil's output
        \item <2-> Drasil is "tested" by comparing generated
              artifacts to \texttt{stable}
              \begin{columns}[T,onlytextwidth]
                  \begin{column}{.4\textwidth}

                  \end{column}

                  \end{column}
              \end{columns}
        \item <3-> This does not actually say anything about Drasil's output!
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Purpose Statement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The purpose of this research is to implement test case generation
              to verify generated code
        \item These test cases will be generated from information within Drasil
        \item<2-> Why use test cases for verification as opposed to, say,
              consistency/correctness checks?
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \item<3-> A more well-defined, Master's level scope
                  \item<4-> Targets a more complex artifact that is harder to verify
                  \item<5-> Gives Drasil another "bragging point"!
              \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Why Test Generated Code?}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Why Test Generated Code?}
    If the code is being generated from a stable knowledge base,
    then it should be correct. Why waste effort testing it?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item<2-> The knowledge base is not actually "stable" yet
        \item<3-> There are plenty of places for a mistake to be introduced
              %, both by Drasil's developers and "end users"
        \item<4-> Testing provides a greater degree of confidence in
              Drasil's capabilities
        \item<5-> Generating code for testing allows for it to be done
              "properly" instead of taking shortcuts commonly taken by humans
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Next Steps}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Next Steps}
    2. Understand the manual artifact (and its components) well
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> Understanding the problem domain lets one develop
              a solution that:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Makes use of all areas of the domain
                  \item Follows domain standards, including quality and terminology
              \end{itemize}
        \item<3-> There are specific areas of testing that need to be understood:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item<4-> \textbf{Research Question \#1:}
                        What information is necessary for different types of testing?
                  \item<5-> \textbf{Research Question \#2:}
                        How can test cases be generated from information that currently
                        exists within Drasil?
                  \item<6-> \textbf{Research Question \#3:}
                        How can new information be added to facilitate the generation of
                        more types of testing?
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \onslide<7-|handout:1>\begin{exampleblock}{}
        {\large "The information you have should be just as useful for generating
            tests as it should be for manually running them."}
        \vspace{3mm}
        \hspace\fill{\small--- Dr.~Jacques Carette}
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Next Steps}
    3. Generate it!
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> Test cases will then be written for:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Other variabilities of Projectile's Python implementation
                  \item Projectile's implementation in other languages
                  \item Other examples where code is generated: GlassBR, NoPCM,
                        DblPendulum, PD Controller \cite{HuntEtAl2021}
              \end{itemize}
        \item<3-> These test cases will also be added to Drasil's CI/CD
              to ensure that future changes preserve the code's functionality
    \end{itemize}
