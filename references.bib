  abstract  = {Software rules in almost all fields of science and technology. Now a days the user classes of a particular software are comparatively high based on their acceptance and quality. So it is the onus of the software developer to ensure that the software is bug free and it will perform the desired functionalities without fail. Software testing is an important activity in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases. In traditional Waterfall model, testing is the life cycle activity that is performed after the design and coding phase. The various research analytics states that nearly 30\% effort of entire software development is used for performing testing activities. So testing activities plays a vital role in developing a quality software. Software testing mainly consists of three categories: Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing. Unit testing basically follows two approaches, Black box testing and White box testing. This paper analyses the various Black box testing methodologies and the issues related to the same.},
