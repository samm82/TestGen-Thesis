\begin{abstract}
    Testing is a pervasive software development activity that is often
    complicated and expensive (if not simply overlooked).  This is in
    part due to an unstable knowledge base: there is no standard, consistent,
    and ``complete'' taxonomy for software testing, inhibiting precise
    communication.
    Discrepancies and ambiguities are widespread throughout the literature, and
    sometimes exist between different parts of the same document!
    % Therefore, automating the software testing process is an area of interest,
    % and understanding the underlying domain is an important prerequisite.
    We systematically investigate the current state of software terminology.
    We 1) identify established standards
    and prominent testing resources,
    2) capture relevant testing terms
    from these sources, along with their definitions and relationships (both
    explicit and implied), and 3) build graphs to visualize and analyze
    this data. Over 500 test approaches were uncovered, as well as
    four methods for describing ``implied'' test approaches. We also build
    a tool to generate graphs of the relations between test
    approaches and track ambiguities captured by this tool and
    manually through the research process. Our results show ten terms are
    given as synonyms to two (or more) disjoint test approaches and 14
    pairs of test approaches may be synonyms and/or have a child-parent
    relationship. There is also confusion surrounding functional, recovery,
    scalability, and performance testing, along with over 40 more
    ``minor'' discrepancies. Overall, there is a need for testing terminology
    to be standardized to make the discussion, analysis, and implementation of
    various test approaches more coherent. We
    provide some preliminary advice on how to accomplish this.

\section{Background}

% TODO: tighten up, add sources

Testing software is complicated, expensive, and often overlooked.
Improving the productivity of testing and testing research requires a standard
language for communication. Unfortunately, a search
for a systematic, rigorous, and ``complete'' taxonomy for software testing
revealed that the existing ones are inadequate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tebes et al. \cite{TebesEtAl2020a} focus on \emph{parts} of the
          testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity),
    \item Souza et al. \cite{SouzaEtAl2017} prioritize organizing testing
          approaches over defining them, and
    \item Unterkalmsteiner et al. \cite{UnterkalmsteinerEtAl2014} provide a
          foundation for classification but not how it applies to software
          testing terminology.
\end{itemize}

Thus we set about closing this gap. We first define the scope of what kinds of
``software testing'' are of interest (\Cref{scope}) and examine the existing
literature (\Cref{method}). This reinforces the need for a proper taxonomy!
Despite the amount of well understood and organized knowledge (\Cref{observ}),
there are still many discrepancies and ambiguities in the literature, either
within the same source or between various sources (\Cref{discrep}). We provide
some potential solutions covering some of these discrepancies (\Cref{recs}).

\section{Conclusion}

While a good starting point, the current literature on software testing has
much room to grow. The many ambiguities and confusions create unnecessary
barriers to software testing. While there is merit to allowing the state-of-%
the-practice terminology to descriptively guide how terminology is used, there
may be a need to prescriptively structure terminology to intentionally
differentiate between and organize various test approaches. Future work in this
area will continue to investigate the current use of terminology, in
particular \nameref{undef-terms}, determine if IEEE's current
\nameref{categories-observ} are sufficient, and rationalize the definitions of
and relations between terms.
