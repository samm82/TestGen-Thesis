\section{Background}

% TODO: tighten up, add sources

Testing software is complicated, expensive, and often expensive. Therefore,
automating the software testing process is an area of interest. In particular,
test case generation for Drasil, a framework for ``generating all of the
software artifacts for (well understood) research software'' \cite{Drasil} was
desired.

Before attempting to automate a knowledge-based process in ad hoc manner, it is
important to understand the underlying domain. This allows the information
itself to drive the scope, including both what is possible and what is needed.
In this case, the goal was to uncover the various approaches towards testing,
as well as which prerequisites (e.g., input files, oracles) existed for each.
A search for a systematic, rigorous, and ``complete'' taxonomy revealed that
existing software testing taxonomies are inadequate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{TebesEtAl2020a} focuses on \emph{parts} of the
          testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity)
    \item \cite{SouzaEtAl2017} prioritizes organizing testing
          approaches over defining them
    \item \cite{UnterkalmsteinerEtAl2014} provides a foundation for
          classification but not how it applies to software testing terminology
\end{itemize}

The ``solution'' to this gap was to examine existing literature (\ref{method}),
which quickly reinforced the need for a taxonomy! Despite the amount of
well understood and organized knowledge (\ref{observ}), there are still many
discrepancies and ambiguities, either within the same source or between various
sources (\ref{discrep}).
