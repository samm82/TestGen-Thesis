\begin{abstract}
    Testing is a pervasive software development activity which is often
    complicated and expensive, while at other times is overlooked.  This is in
    part due an unstable knowledge base: there is no standard, consistent, and
    ``complete'' taxonomy for software testing, inhibiting precise
    communication.
    Discrepancies and ambiguities are widespread throughout the literature, and
    sometimes exist between different parts of the same document!
    % Therefore, automating the software testing process is an area of interest,
    % and understanding the underlying domain is an important prerequisite.
    We systematically investigate the current state of software terminology.
    We 1) identify established standards
    and prominent testing resources, 
    2) capture relevant testing terms
    from these sources, along with their definitions and relationships (both
    explicit and implied), and 
    3) build graphs to visualize and analyze
    this data. Over five hundred test approaches were
    uncovered, as well as
    some methods for describing ``implied'' test approaches. We also built
    a tool to generate graphs of the relations between test
    approaches and track their ambiguities, as well as those captured
    manually through the research process. Our results show ten terms are
    given as synonyms to two (or more) disjoint test approaches and fourteen
    pairs of test approaches may be synonyms and/or have a child-parent
    relationship. There is also confusion surrounding functional, recovery,
    scalability, and performance testing, along with over fifty more
    ``minor'' discrepancies. Overall, there is a need for testing terminology
    to be standardized to make the discussion, analysis, and implementation of
    various test approaches more coherent. We
    provide some preliminary advice on how to accomplish this.

\section{Background}

% TODO: tighten up, add sources

Testing software is complicated, expensive, and often overlooked.

, we wanted to
automate the generation of tests. As we did not want to do this in an
ad hoc manner, we wanted to get a good grasp on the target domain, testing.

The goal was to uncover the various approaches towards testing, as well as
which prerequisites (e.g., input files, oracles) are needed for each.  A search
for a systematic, rigorous, and ``complete'' taxonomy for software testing
revealed that the existing ones are inadequate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{TebesEtAl2020a} focuses on \emph{parts} of the
          testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity),
    \item \cite{SouzaEtAl2017} prioritizes organizing testing
          approaches over defining them,
    \item \cite{UnterkalmsteinerEtAl2014} provides a foundation for
          classification but not how it applies to software testing terminology.
\end{itemize}

Thus we set about closing this gap. We first define the scope of what kinds of
``software testing'' are of interest (\ref{scope}) and examine the existing
literature (\ref{method}). This reinforced the need for a proper taxonomy!
Despite the amount of well understood and organized knowledge (\ref{observ}),
there are still many discrepancies and ambiguities in the literature, either
within the same source or between various sources (\ref{discrep}). We provide
some potential solutions covering some of these discrepancies (\ref{recs}).
