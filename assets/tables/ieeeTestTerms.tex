        Approach               & A ``high-level test
        implementation choice, typically made as part of the test strategy
        design activity'' that includes ``test level, test type, test technique,
        test practice and the form of static testing to be used''
        \cite[p.~10]{IEEE2022} & any of the examples given below:
        equivalence partitioning, unit testing, scripted testing,

        \techniqueCell{}       & A ``procedure used to
        create or select a test model, identify test
        coverage items, and derive corresponding test cases''

        boundary value analysis, branch testing \cite[p.~11]{IEEE2022}               \\
        Level                  & A stage of testing ``typically
        associated with the achievement of particular objectives
        and used to treat particular risks''

        exploratory testing, automated testing \cite[p.~20]{IEEE2022}                \\
