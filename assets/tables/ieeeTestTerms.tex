\newcommand{\procLevel}{``Test level'' can also refer to the scope
    of a test process; for example, a process may ``apply across the whole
    organization'' or only ``to specific projects'' \citep[p.~24]{IEEE2022}.}
\newcommand{\phaseDef}{``Test phase'' can be a synonym for ``test level''
    (\citealp[p.~469]{IEEE2017}; \citealp[p.~9]{IEEE2013}) but can also refer to the
    ``period of time in the software life cycle'' when testing occurs
    \citep[p.~470]{IEEE2017}, usually after the implementation phase (pp.~420, 509).}

        Approach                          & A ``high-level test
        implementation choice, typically made as part of the test strategy
        design activity'' that includes ``test level, test type, test technique,
        test practice and the form of static testing to be used''
        \citep[p.~10]{IEEE2022}; described by a \emph{test strategy}
        \citep[p.~472]{IEEE2017} and is also used to ``pick the particular test case
        values'' \citep[p.~465]{IEEE2017} & black or white box, minimum and maximum
        boundary value testing \citep[p.~465]{IEEE2017}                                                \\
        \techniqueCell{}                  & A ``defined'' and ``systematic''
        \citep[p.~464]{IEEE2017} ``procedure used to
        create or select a test model, identify test
        coverage items, and derive corresponding test cases''
        (\citealp[p.~11]{IEEE2022}; similar in \citealp[p.~467]{IEEE2017});
        ``a variety \dots is typically
        required to suitably cover any system'' \citep[p.~33]{IEEE2022} and is
        ``often selected based on team skills and familiarity,
        on the format of the test basis'', and on expectations
        \citep[p.~23]{IEEE2022}           & equivalence partitioning,
        boundary value analysis, branch testing \citep[p.~11]{IEEE2022}                                \\

        ``typically associated with the achievement of particular objectives
        and used to treat particular risks'' \citep[p.~12]{IEEE2022} with
        ``its own documentation and resources'' \citep[p.~469]{IEEE2017}; more
        generally, ``designat[es] \dots the coverage and detail''
        \citep[p.~249]{IEEE2017}          & unit/component testing,
        integration testing, system testing (\citealp[p.~12]{IEEE2022};

        Practice                          & A ``conceptual framework

        (\citealp[p.~14]{IEEE2022}; \citealp[p.~471]{IEEE2017}; OG IEEE 2013);
        more generally, a ``specific type of activity
        that contributes to the execution of a process''
        \citep[p.~331]{IEEE2017}          & scripted testing,
        exploratory testing, automated testing \citep[p.~20]{IEEE2022}                                 \\
