    To better understand our findings, we build tools to more intuitively
    visualize relations between test approaches (\Cref{graph-gen}) and
    automatically track their discrepancies (\Cref{discrep-analysis}). Doing
    this manually would be error-prone due to the amount of data involved (for
    example, we identify \approachCount{} test approaches) and the number of
    situations where the underlying data would change, including more detailed
    analysis, error corrections, and the addition of data. These all require
    tedious updates to the corresponding graphs that may be overlooked or done
    incorrectly. Besides being more systematic, automating these processes also
    allows us to observe the impacts of smaller changes, such as unexpected
    discrepancies that arise from a new relation between two approaches. It
    also helps verify the tools themselves; for example, adding a manual
    discrepancy should affect relevant discrepancy counts, and we can
    double-check this.
