\ifnotpaper
    To better understand our findings, we build tools to more intuitively
    visualize relations between test approaches (\Cref{graph-gen}) and
    automatically track their flaws (\Cref{discrep-analysis}). Doing
    this manually would be error-prone due to the amount of data involved (for
    example, we identify \approachCount{} test approaches) and the number of
    situations where the underlying data would change, including more detailed
    analysis, error corrections, and the addition of data. These all require
    tedious updates to the corresponding graphs that may be overlooked or done
    incorrectly. Besides being more systematic, automating these processes also
    allows us to observe the impacts of smaller changes, such as unexpected
    flaws that arise from a new relation between two approaches. It
    also helps verify the tools themselves; for example, tracking a flaw
    manually should affect relevant flaw counts, and we can
    double-check this. We also define macros to help achieve our goals of
    maintainability, traceability, and reproducibility (\Cref{macros}).

    \subsection{Approach Graph Generation}
    \label{graph-gen}
\fi

To better visualize how test approaches relate to each other, we
develop a tool to automatically generate graphs of these relations.
\ifnotpaper Since synonym (see \Cref{syn-rels}) and parent-child relations
    (see \Cref{par-chd-rels}) between approaches are tracked in
    \ourApproachGlossary{} in a consistent format, they can be parsed
    systematically. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    appear in the glossary, then their parent relations are displayed as
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph} in the generated graph. Relevant citation
    information is also captured in our glossary following the author-year
    citation format, including ``reusing'' information from previous
    citations. For example, the first row of \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    contains the citation ``(Author, 0000; 0001)'', which means that this
    information was present in two documents by ``Author'': one written in
    the year 0000, and one in 0001. The following citation, ``(0000)'',
    contains no author, which means it was written by the same one as the
    previous citation. These citations are processed according to this
    logic \seeSrcCode{897d048}{csvToGraph}{54}{95} so they can be
    consistently tracked throughout the analysis.

    \def\exampleTableNote{``Name'' can refer to the name of a test approach,
        software quality, or other testing-related term, but we only generated
        graphs for test approaches.}

All parent-child relations are graphed, since they are guaranteed to be
visually meaningful. Synonym relations, however, are either excluded from or
included in graphs as follows.\todo{Is this correct grammar?} For each synonym
pair, at least one term will have its own row (or else it would not appear in
the glossary at all), so the following cases are possible:
\begin{description}
    \item[1. (Excluded)] \ifnotpaper\else \hfill\break \fi
          \textbf{Only one synonym has its own row.}
          This is a ``typical'' synonym relation (see \Cref{syn-rels}) where
          the terms are interchangeable. The synonym \emph{could} be included
          as an alternate name inside the node of its partner, but this would
          unnecessarily clutter the graphs.

          % Reference for singular 'row': https://ell.stackexchange.com/q/105868/169502
    \item[2. (Included)] \ifnotpaper\else \hfill\break \fi
          \textbf{Both synonyms have their own row in the glossary.}
          This may indicate that the synonym relation is
          incorrect, since separate rows in the glossary define separate
          approaches (with their own definitions, nuances, etc.).

    \item[3. (Included)] \ifnotpaper\phantomsection{}\label{case-three}
          \else\hfill\break\fi
          \textbf{Two synonym pairs share a synonym without its own row.}
          This is a transitive extension to the previous case. If
          two distinct approaches share a synonym, that implies that they are
          synonyms themselves, resulting in the same possibility of the
          relation being incorrect.

        These conditions are deduced from the information parsed
        from the glossary. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary}
        appear in the glossary, then they are displayed as \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}
        in the generated graph (note that X does not appear since it does not
        meet the criteria given above).
    \end{minipage} \newpage

    This allows for automatic detection of some classes of flaws. The
    most trivial to automate is ``multi-synonym'' relations, given in
    % TODO: pretty hacky
    \hyperref[case-three]{Case 3} above, since these are already found in order
    to generate the graph as desired. The list found in \Cref{multiSyns}
    is automatically generated based on glossary entries such as those found
    in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary}. The self-referential definitions in
    \Cref{selfPars} were also trivial, found by simply looking for lines in
    the generated .tex files with prefixes of the form \texttt{I -> I} (where
    \texttt{I} is the label used for a test approach node in these graphs).
    This process results in output similar to \Cref{fig:selfExampleGraph}. A
    similar process is used to detect instances where two approaches have a
    synonym \emph{and} a parent-child relation. A dictionary of each term's
    synonyms is built to evaluate which synonym relations are notable
    enough to include in the graph, and these mappings are then checked to
    see if one appears as a parent of the other. For example, if \texttt{J}
    and \texttt{K} are synonyms, a generated .tex file with a parent line
    starting with \texttt{J -> K} would result in these approaches being
    graphed as shown in \Cref{fig:parSynExampleGraph}.

    The visual nature of these graphs makes it possible to represent both
    explicit and implicit relations without double counting them during the
    analysis in \Cref{discrep-analysis}. If a relation is both explicit
    \emph{and} implicit, the implicit relation is only shown in the graph
    if it is from a more ``trusted'' source tier (see \Cref{sources}).
    For example, note that only the explicit synonym relation between E and F
    from \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary} is shown in \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}.
    Implicit approaches and relations are denoted by dashed lines, as shown
    in \Cref{fig:exampleGraph,fig:synExampleGraph}; explicit approaches are
    \emph{always} denoted by solid lines, even if they are also implicit.
    ``Rigid'' versions of these graphs that exclude implicit approaches and
    relations can also be generated; the rigid version of
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph} is given in \Cref{fig:rigidExampleGraph}.

\fi
Since these graphs tend to be large, it is useful to focus on specific
subsets of them. \ifnotpaper To do this, we generated graphs limited to
    approaches in a selected approach category (see \Cref{categories-observ})
    as well as a graph of static approaches. The latter is done because
    \citet[Fig.~2]{IEEE2022} \multiAuthHelper{consider} static testing to be a
    separate approach category and because static testing is quite different
    from dynamic testing (see \Cref{static-test}). Generated graphs focused
    on static testing include any relations with dynamic approaches (since
    they are our primary focus) and these dynamic approach nodes are
    colored grey, as shown in \Cref{fig:staticExampleGraph}.

    Additionally, more specific subsets of these graphs \else These \fi
can be generated from a given subset of approaches, such as
\ifnotpaper\else those in a selected approach category (see
    \Cref{categories-observ}) or \fi those pertaining to recovery or
scability\ifnotpaper. These areas are of particular note, with their own
sections for discussing flaws (\Cref{recov-discrep,scal-discrep},
respectively). Graphs of just these subsets help visualize relations
between relevant test approaches, so these are generated and given
\else; the latter are shown \fi in \Cref{fig:recovery-graph-current,%
    fig:scal-graph-current}, respectively. By specifying sets of approaches
and relations to add or remove,
these generated graphs can then be updated in accordance with our
recommendations; applying those given in \Cref{rec-test-rec,,scal-test-rec,,%
    \ifnotpaper\else perf-test-rec\fi} results in the updated graphs in
\Cref{fig:recovery-graph-proposed,,fig:scal-graph-proposed,,\ifnotpaper\else
        fig:perf-graph\fi}, respectively. Any added approaches or relations are
colored \textcolor{orange}{orange}.
\ifnotpaper
    Recommendations can also be inherited; for example,
    \Cref{fig:perf-graph} was generated based on the modifications from
    \Cref{fig:recovery-graph-proposed,fig:scal-graph-proposed} along with
    other changes mentioned in \Cref{perf-test-rec}.
