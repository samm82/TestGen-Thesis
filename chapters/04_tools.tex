    To better understand our findings, we build tools to more intuitively
    visualize relations between test approaches (\Cref{graph-gen}) and
    automatically track their discrepancies (\Cref{discrep-analysis}). Doing
    this manually would be error-prone due to the amount of data involved (for
    example, we identify \approachCount{} test approaches) and the number of
    situations where the underlying data would change, including more detailed
    analysis, error corrections, and the addition of data. These all require
    tedious updates to the corresponding graphs that may be overlooked or done
    incorrectly. Besides being more systematic, automating these processes also
    allows us to observe the impacts of smaller changes, such as unexpected
    discrepancies that arise from a new relation between two approaches. It
    also helps verify the tools themselves; for example, adding a manual
    discrepancy should affect relevant discrepancy counts, and we can
    double-check this.

    \subsection{Approach Graph Generation}
    \label{graph-gen}
\fi

To better visualize how test approaches relate to each other, we
develop a tool to automatically generate graphs of these relations.
\ifnotpaper Since parent-child and synonym relations between approaches are
    tracked in \ifblind{our approach glossary}{\href{
            https://github.com/samm82/TestGen-Thesis/blob/main/ApproachGlossary.csv
        }{our approach glossary}} in a consistent format, they can be parsed
    systematically. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    appear in the glossary, then their parent relations are displayed as
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph} in the generated graph. Relevant citation
    information is also captured in our glossary following the author-year
    citation format, including ``reusing'' information from previous
    citations. For example, the first row of \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    contains the citation ``(Author, 0000; 0001)'', which means that this
    information was present in two documents by ``Author'': one written in
    the year 0000, and one in 0001. The following citation, ``(0000)'',
    contains no author, which means it was written by the same one as the
    previous citation. These citations are processed according to this
    logic \seeSrcCode{30d8c96}{csvToGraph}{53}{94} so they can be
    consistently tracked throughout the analysis.

    \begin{table}[hbtp!]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ll} \hline
            Name                        & Parent(s)                        \\ \hline
            A                           & B (Author, 0000; 0001), C (0000) \\
            B                           & C (implied by Author, 0000)      \\
            C                           & D (Author, 0002)                 \\
            D (implied by Author, 0002) &                                  \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Example glossary entries demonstrating how parent relations are tracked.}
        \label{tab:exampleGlossary}
    \end{table}

    \ExampleGraph{}

    \newpage\fi
All parent-child relations are graphed, as well as synonym relations where either:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item both synonyms have their own rows in the glossary, or
    \item a term is a synonym to more than one term with its own row in the
          glossary.
\end{enumerate}
\ifnotpaper These conditions are also deduced from the information parsed
    from the glossary. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary}
    appear in the glossary, then they are displayed as \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}
    in the generated graph (note that X does not appear since it does not
    meet the criteria given above).

    \begin{table}[hbtp!]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ll} \hline
            Name & Synonym(s)                            \\ \hline
            E    & F (Author, 0000; implied by 0001)     \\
            G    & F (Author, 0002), H (implied by 0000) \\
            H    & X                                     \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Example glossary entries demonstrating how synonym relations are tracked.}
        \label{tab:synExampleGlossary}
    \end{table}

    This allows for automatic detection of some classes of discrepancies. The
    most trivial to automate is ``multi-synonym'' relations, which are already
    found to generate the graph as desired. The list found in \Cref{multiSyns}
    is automatically generated based on glossary entries such as those found
    in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary}. The self-referential definitions in
    \Cref{selfPars} were also trivial, found by simply looking for lines in
    the generated .tex files starting with \texttt{I -> I} which would
    result in the graph in \Cref{fig:selfExampleGraph}. A similar process
    is used to detect instances where two approaches have a synonym
    \emph{and} a parent-child relation. A dictionary of each term's
    synonyms is built to evaluate which synonym relations are notable
    enough to include in the graph, and these mappings are then checked to
    see if one appears as a parent of the other. For example, if J and K
    are synonyms, a generated .tex file with a parent line starting with
    \texttt{J -> K} would result in these approaches being graphed as shown
    in \Cref{fig:parSynExampleGraph}.

    The visual nature of these graphs makes it possible to represent both
    explicit and implicit relations without double counting them during the
    analysis in \Cref{discrep-analysis}. If a relation is both explicit
    \emph{and} implicit, the implicit relation is only shown in the graph
    if it is from a more ``trusted'' source category (see \Cref{sources});
    note that only the explicit synonym relation between E and F
    from \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary} is shown in \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}.
    Implicit approaches and relations are denoted by dashed lines, as shown
    in \Cref{fig:exampleGraph,fig:synExampleGraph}; explicit approaches are
    \emph{always} denoted by solid lines, even if they are also implicit.
    ``Rigid'' versions of these graphs that exclude implicit approaches and
    relations can also be generated; the rigid version of
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph} is given in \Cref{fig:rigidExampleGraph}.

\fi
Since these graphs tend to be large, it is useful to focus on specific
subsets of them. \ifnotpaper To do this, we generated graphs limited to
    approaches in a selected approach category (see \Cref{categories-observ})
    as well as a graph of static approaches. The latter is done both
    because \citet[Fig.~2]{IEEE2022} \multiAuthHelper{consider} static
    testing a separate approach category and since it is quite different
    from dynamic testing (see \Cref{static-test}). Generated graphs focused
    on static testing include any relations with dynamic approaches (since
    they are our primary focus), and these dynamic approach nodes are
    colored gray, as shown in \Cref{fig:staticExampleGraph}.

    Additionally, more specific subsets of these graphs \else These \fi
can be generated from a given subset of approaches, such as
\ifnotpaper\else those in a selected approach category (see
    \Cref{categories-observ}) or \fi those pertaining to recovery or
scability\ifnotpaper. These areas are of particular note, with their own
sections for discussing discrepancies (\Cref{recov-discrep,scal-discrep},
respectively). Graphs of just these subsets help visualize relations
between relevant test approaches, so these are generated and given
\else; the latter are shown \fi in \Cref{fig:recovery-graph-current,%
    fig:scal-graph-current}, respectively (albeit with manually created
legends). By specifying sets of approaches and relations to add or remove,
these generated graphs can then be updated in accordance with our
recommendations; applying those given in \Cref{rec-test-rec,,scal-test-rec,,%
    \ifnotpaper\else perf-test-rec\fi} results in the updated graphs in
\Cref{fig:recovery-graph-proposed,,fig:scal-graph-proposed,,\ifnotpaper\else
        fig:perf-graph\fi}, respectively.
\ifnotpaper
    Recommendations can also be inherited; for example,
    \Cref{fig:perf-graph} was generated based on the modifications from
    \Cref{fig:recovery-graph-proposed,fig:scal-graph-proposed} along with
    other changes mentioned in \Cref{perf-test-rec}.
