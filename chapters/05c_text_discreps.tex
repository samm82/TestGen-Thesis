\paragraph{High Severity}
\begin{itemize}
      \item State testing requires that ``all states in the state model
            \dots\ [are] `visited'\,'' in \citep[p.~19]{IEEE2021} which
            is only one of its possible criteria in \citep[pp.~82-83]{Patton2006}.
      \item ``Load testing'' is defined as using loads ``usually between
            anticipated conditions of low, typical, and peak usage''
            \citep[p.~5]{IEEE2022}, while \citeauthor{Patton2006} says the
            loads should as large as possible \citeyearpar[p.~86]{Patton2006}.
      \item \citeauthor{PetersAndPedrycz2000} claim that ``structural testing
            subsumes white box testing'', but they seem to describe the same
            thing: they say ``structure tests are aimed at exercising the
            internal logic of a software system'' and ``in white box testing
            \dots, using detailed knowledge of code, one creates a battery of
            tests in such a way that they exercise all components of the code
            (say, statements, branches, paths)'' on the same page
            \citeyearpar[p.~447]{PetersAndPedrycz2000}!
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Medium Severity}
\begin{itemize}
      \item \citeauthor{Patton2006} says that reviews are ``the process[es] under
            which static white-box testing is performed''
            \citeyearpar[p.~92]{Patton2006}, but \citeauthor{vanVliet2000}
            also gives correctness proofs \citeyearpar[pp.~418-419]{vanVliet2000}.
      \item \citeauthor{ISTQB_author} claim that code inspections are
            related to peer reviews \citeyearpar{ISTQB}, but
            \citet[pp.~94-95]{Patton2006} makes them quite distinct.
      \item \phantomsection{} \label{walkthrough-syns}
            Likewise, ``walkthroughs'' and ``structured walkthroughs''
            are given as synonyms by \citetISTQB{} but
            \citeauthor{PetersAndPedrycz2000} imply that they are
            different by saying a more structured walkthrough may have
            specific roles \citeyearpar[p.~484]{PetersAndPedrycz2000}.
