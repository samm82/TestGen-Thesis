            State testing requires that ``all states in the state model
            \dots\ [are] `visited'\,'' in \citep[p.~19]{IEEE2021} which
            is only one of its possible criteria in \citep[pp.~82-83]{Patton2006}.
      \item % Discrep count (DEFS): {IEEE2022} | {Patton2006}
            ``Load testing'' is defined as using loads ``usually between
            anticipated conditions of low, typical, and peak usage''
            \citep[p.~5]{IEEE2022}, while \citeauthor{Patton2006} says the
            loads should as large as possible \citeyearpar[p.~86]{Patton2006}.

\paragraph{Medium Severity}
\begin{itemize}
      \item % Discrep count (DEFS): implied by {Patton2006} | {vanVliet2000}
            \citeauthor{Patton2006} says that reviews are ``\emph{the} process[es]
            under which static white-box testing is performed''
            \citeyearpar[p.~92, emphasis added]{Patton2006}, but
            \citeauthor{vanVliet2000} also gives correctness proofs
            \citeyearpar[pp.~418-419]{vanVliet2000}.
