\subsection{Source Order}
\label{source-order}
As there is no single authoritative source on software testing terminology,
we need to look at many. Unfortunately, this brings to light a variety of
discrepancies. Starting from some set of sources, we then use
``snowballing'' % needs a reference!
to gather further sources.

\begin{enumerate}
      \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
      \item Trusted textbooks
            \citep{Patton2006, PetersAndPedrycz2000, vanVliet2000}
            \begin{itemize}

            \end{itemize}
      \item Established standards (such as IEEE, ISO/IEC, and SWEBOK)
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Standards organizations \citep{IEEE2022, IEEE2017,

                  \item ``Meta-level'' commentaries or collections of
                        terminology (often based on these standards)

            , sources investigated to
            ``fill in'' missing definitions\seeSectionParAlways{undef-terms},
            and testing-related resources that emerged for unrelated reasons
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Colored black, along with any ``surface-level''
                        analysis that followed straightforwardly.
            \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Procedure}

All sources were analyzed in their entirety, except for some in
\nameref{undef-terms}, to systematically extract terminology.
Heuristics were used to guide this process, by investigating\dots

\begin{itemize}
      \item glossaries and lists of terms,
      \item testing-related terms\\
            e.g., terms that included ``test(ing)'', ``validation'',
            ``verification'', ``review(s)'', or ``audit(s)'',
      \item terms that had emerged as part of already-discovered
            testing approaches, \emph{especially} those that were ambiguous
            or prompted further discussion\\
            e.g., terms that included ``performance'', ``recovery'',
            ``component'', ``bottom-up'', ``boundary'', or ``configuration'', and
      \item terms that implied testing approaches%
            \ifnotpaper\footnote{
                        Since these methods for deriving test approaches only arose
                        as research progressed, some examples would have been missed
                        during the first pass(es) of resources investigated earlier
                        in the process. While reiterating over them would be ideal,
                        this may not be possible due to time constraints.
                  }\fi%
            \seeSectionParAlways{derived-tests}.
\end{itemize}

When terms had multiple definitions, either the clearest and most concise
version was kept, or they were merged to paint a more complete picture.
If any discrepancies or ambiguities
arose, they were reasonably investigated and always documented. If a
testing approach was mentioned but not defined, it was still added to the
glossary to indicate it should be investigated further%
\seeSectionParAlways{undef-terms}. A similar methodology
was used for tracking software qualities, albeit in a separate
document\seeSectionParAlways{derived-tests}.

During the first pass of data collection, all software-testing-focused terms
were included. Some of them are less applicable to test case automation
(such as \nameref{static-test}\ifnotpaper{, \thesisissueref{39}}\fi) or too
broad (such as \nameref{attacks}\ifnotpaper{, \thesisissueref{55}}\fi), so they
will be omitted over the course of analysis.

\ifnotpaper
      During this investigation, some terms came up that seemed to be relevant to
      testing but were so vague, they didn't provide any new information. These were
      decided to be not worth tracking\seeThesisIssuePar{39}[, \thesisissueref{44},
            \thesisissueref{28}] and are listed below:

      \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Evaluation:} the ``systematic determination of the extent
                  to which an entity meets its specified criteria''
                  \citep[p.~167]{IEEE2017}
            \item \textbf{Product Analysis:} the ``process of evaluating a product by
                  manual or automated means to determine if the product has certain
                  characteristics'' \citep[p.~343]{IEEE2017}
            \item \textbf{Quality Audit:} ``a structured, independent process to
                  determine if project activities comply with organizational and
                  project policies, processes, and procedures'' \citep[p.~361]{IEEE2017}
                  \todo{OG PMBOK}
            \item \textbf{Software Product Evaluation:} a ``technical operation that
                  consists of producing an assessment of one or more characteristics
                  of a software product according to a specified procedure''
                  \citep[p.~424]{IEEE2017}
      \end{itemize}
\fi

\subsection{Undefined Terms}
\label{undef-terms}

% Define values to be easily reused and used in calculation!

\newcount\TotalBefore
\newcount\TotalAfter
\newcount\UndefBefore
\newcount\UndefAfter

\TotalBefore=432
\UndefBefore=153

\TotalAfter=515
\UndefAfter=171

This search process led to some testing approaches being
mentioned without definition;
\citep{IEEE2022} and \citep{Firesmith2015} in particular introduced many.
Once ``standard'' sources had been exhausted, we devised a strategy to
look for sources that explicitly defined these terms, consistent with
our snowballing approach. This uncovered new approaches, both in and out of
scope (such as EMSEC testing, HTML testing, and aspects of loop testing and
orthogonal array testing\seeSectionPar{scope}).

The following terms (and their respective related terms)
were explored%
\ifnotpaper
      { in the following sources}%
\fi, bringing the number of testing
approaches from \the\TotalBefore~to \the\TotalAfter~and the number of
\emph{undefined} terms from \the\UndefBefore~to \the\UndefAfter~(the assumption
can be made that about \the\numexpr 100 - 100 * (\UndefAfter - \UndefBefore) /
(\TotalAfter - \TotalBefore)\relax\% of added terms also included a definition):
