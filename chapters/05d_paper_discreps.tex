                  \citeauthor{DoğanEtAl2014} claim that \citep{SakamotoEtAl2013}
                  defines ``prime path coverage'' \citeyearpar[p.~184]{DoğanEtAl2014},
                  but it doesn't.
            \item % Discrep count (TERMS): {Kam2008}
                  ``State-based'' is misspelled by \citeauthor{Kam2008} as
                  ``state-base'' \citeyearpar[pp.~13,~15]{Kam2008} and
                  ``stated-base'' \citetext{Tab.~1}.

                  % TODO: BAD TERMS?
                  The phrase ``continuous automated testing''  \citep[p.~11]{Gerrard2000a}
                  is redundant since continuous testing is a sub-category of automated
                  testing (\citealp[p.~35]{IEEE2022}, \citealpISTQB{}).
