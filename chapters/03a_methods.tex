To better understand our findings, we built tools to visualize the
relations between test approaches more intuitively (\Cref{graph-gen}) and track
discrepancies surrounding them automatically (\Cref{discrep-count}).

\subsection{Discrepancy Counting}
\label{discrep-count}

In addition to analyzing specific discrepancies (or classes of discrepancies),
an overview of the amount, severity, and source of these discrepancies is also
useful. Subsets of this task can be automated, and even parts that need to be
done manually (such as finding and categorizing the discrepancies from
\Cref{other-discrep}) can be augmented with automated tools.

As outlined in \Cref{graph-gen}, some types of discrepancies can be detected
automatically. Purely counting the total number of these types of
discrepancies is then trivial. Slightly less-trivial is tracking the source
category of these discrepancies, as well as whether they are explicit or
implicit, as done in \Cref{tab:discreps}. Since the appropriate citations for
each piece of information is tracked (see \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary,%
    tab:synExampleGlossary} for examples of how these citations are formatted
in the glossaries), they can be taken into consideration when performing
these counts.
