\begin{itemize}
    \item The following branches of testing started as parts of quality
          testing:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Reliability testing \cite[p.~18, ch.~10]{fenton_software_1997}
              \item Performance testing \cite[p.~18, ch.~7]{fenton_software_1997}
          \end{itemize}
    \item Reliability and maintainability can start to be tested even without
          code by ``measur[ing] structural attributes of representations of the
          software'' \cite[p.~18]{fenton_software_1997}
    \item The US Software Engineering Institute has a checklist for determining
          which types of lines of code are included when counting
          \cite[pp.~30-31]{fenton_software_1997}
    \item Measurements should include an entity to be measured, a specific
          attribute to measure, and the actual measure (i.e., units, starting
          state, ending state, what to include) \cite[p.~36]{fenton_software_1997}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item These attributes must be defined before they can be
                    measured \cite[p.~38]{fenton_software_1997}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
