\section{Background}

% TODO: tighten up, add sources

Testing software is complicated, expensive, and often overlooked.
Improving the productivity of testing and testing research requires a standard
language for communication. Unfortunately, a search
for a systematic, rigorous, and ``complete'' taxonomy for software testing
revealed that the existing ones are inadequate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \ifnotpaper\else Tebes et al. \fi\citet{TebesEtAl2020a} focus on
          \emph{parts} of the testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity),
    \item \ifnotpaper\else Souza et al. \fi\citet{SouzaEtAl2017} prioritize
          organizing testing approaches over defining them, and
    \item \ifnotpaper\else Unterkalmsteiner et al. \fi\citet{UnterkalmsteinerEtAl2014}
          provide a foundation for classification but not how it applies to software
          testing terminology.
\end{itemize}

Thus we set about closing this gap. We first define the scope of what kinds of
``software testing'' are of interest (\Cref{scope}) and examine the existing
literature (\Cref{methodology}). This reinforces the need for a proper taxonomy!
Despite the amount of well understood and organized knowledge (\Cref{observ}),
there are still many discrepancies and ambiguities in the literature, either
within the same source or between various sources (\Cref{discrep}). We provide
some potential solutions covering some of these discrepancies (\Cref{recs}).
