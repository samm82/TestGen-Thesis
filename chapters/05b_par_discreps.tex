          security testing are given as subtypes of reliability testing by
          \citep{ISO_IEC2023a}, but these are all listed
          separately by \citep[p.~53]{Firesmith2015}. \ifnotpaper

          \citeauthor*{IEEE2017} provide a definition for ``inspections and
          audits'' \citeyearpar[p.~228]{IEEE2017}, despite also giving
          definitions for ``inspection'' \citetext{p.~227} and ``audit''
          \citetext{p.~36}; while the first term \emph{could} be considered a
          superset of the latter two, this distinction doesn't seem useful.
