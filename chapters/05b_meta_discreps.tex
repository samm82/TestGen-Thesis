            The terms ``acceleration'' and ``acoustic tolerance testing'' seem
            to only refer to software testing in \citep[p.~56]{Firesmith2015};
            elsewhere, they seem to refer to testing the acoustic tolerance of
            rats \citep{HolleyEtAl1996} or the acceleration tolerance of
            \accelTolTest{}, which don't exactly seem relevant\dots\fi

            % is used as the ground truth
            ``Par sheet testing'' from \citepISTQB{} seems to refer to the
            specific example brought up in \hyperref[specificISTQB]
            {this definition discrepancy} and does not seem more widely
            applicable, since a ``PAR sheet'' is ``a list of all the symbols
            on each reel of a slot machine'' \citep{Bluejay2024}.

\paragraph{Low Severity}
\begin{itemize}
      \item % Discrep count (SRCS): ISTQB
            The source cited for the definition of ``test type'' from
            \citepISTQB{} does not seem to provide a definition itself.
      \item % Discrep count (SRCS): ISTQB
            The same is true for ``visual testing'' \citepISTQB{}.
      \item % Discrep count (SRCS): ISTQB
            The same is true for ``security attack'' \citepISTQB{}.
      \item % Discrep count (TERMS): {Firesmith2015} | {Firesmith2015} {PreußeEtAl2012}
            ``Hardware-'' and ``human-in-the-loop testing'' have the same
            acronym: ``HIL''\footnote{``HiL'' is used for the former by
                  \citet[p.~2]{PreußeEtAl2012}.} \citep[p.~23]{Firesmith2015}.
      \item % Discrep count (TERMS): {Firesmith2015}
            The same is true for ``customer'' and ``contract(ual) acceptance
            testing'' (``CAT'') \citep[p.~30]{Firesmith2015}.
