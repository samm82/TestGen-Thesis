            ``Compatibility testing'' is defined as ``testing that measures the
            degree to which a test item can function satisfactorily alongside
            other independent products in a shared environment (co-existence),
            and where necessary, exchanges information with other systems or
            components (interoperability)'' \citep[p.~3]{IEEE2022}. This
            definition is nonatomic as it combines the ideas of ``co-existence''
            and ``interoperability''. The term ``interoperability testing'' is
            not defined, but is used three times \citep[pp.~22,~43]{IEEE2022}
            % Discrep count (TERMS): {IEEE2022}
            (although the third usage seems like it should be ``portability
            testing''). This implies that ``co-existence testing'' and
            ``interoperability testing'' should be defined as their own terms,
            which is supported by definitions of ``co-existence'' and
            ``interoperability'' often being separate

                        The ``interoperability'' element of ``compatibility
                        testing'' is explicitly excluded by
                        \citet[p.~37]{IEEE2021}, (incorrectly) implying that
                        ``compatibility testing'' and ``co-existence testing''
                        are synonyms.

                        \citep[p.~43]{Kam2008} unhelpfully says ``See
                        \emph{interoperability testing}'', adding another
                        layer of confusion to the direction of their

            Retesting and regression testing seem to be separated from the rest

                  Integration, system, and system integration testing are all listed
                  as ``common test levels'' (\citealp[p.~12]{IEEE2022};
                  \citeyear[p.~6]{IEEE2021}), but no
                  definitions are given for the latter two, making it unclear what
                  ``system integration testing'' is; it is a combination of the two?
                  somewhere on the spectrum between them? It is listed as a child
                  % Discrep count (PARS): ISTQB | {Firesmith2015}
                  of integration testing by \citetISTQB{} and of system testing

                  Similarly, component, integration, and component integration
                  testing are all listed in \citep{IEEE2017}, but ``component
                  integration testing'' is only defined as ``testing of groups of
                  related components'' \citep[p.~82]{IEEE2017}; it is a combination of
                  the two? somewhere on the spectrum between them? As above, it is

                  A typo in \citep[Fig.~2]{IEEE2021} means that ``specification-based
                  techniques'' is listed twice, when the latter should be
                  ``structure-based techniques''.

                  \citeauthor*{IEEE2017} provide a definition for ``inspections and
                  audits'' \citeyearpar[p.~228]{IEEE2017}, despite also giving
                  definitions for ``inspection'' (p.~227) and ``audit'' (p.~36);
                  while the first term \emph{could} be considered a superset of the
                  latter two, this distinction doesn't seem useful.
