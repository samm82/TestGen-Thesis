          While \ifnotpaper \else ISO/IEC and IEEE \fi \citet[p.~8]{IEEE2022}
          say regression testing and retesting are two distinct approaches
          (as does \citet[p.~34]{Firesmith2015}), they define regression
          testing as a form of ``selective retesting'' in
          \citeyearpar[p.~372]{IEEE2017} (as does \citet[pp.~5-8, 6-5,
              7-5~to~7-6]{SWEBOK2024}). Moreover, the two possible variations
          of regression testing given by \cite[p.~411]{vanVliet2000} are
          ``retest-all'' and ``selective retest''\todo{Are these separate

          A component is an ``entity with discrete structure \dots\ within a
          system considered at a particular level of analysis''
          \citep{ISO_IEC2023b} and ``the terms module, component, and unit

          \citep[p.~419]{IEEE2017} and ``can be tested in isolation''
          \citepISTQB{}, ``unit/component/module testing'' could refer to the
          testing of both a module \emph{and} a specific function in a module%
