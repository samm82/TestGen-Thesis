          Similarly, component testing, integration testing, and component

          A component is an ``entity with discrete structure \dots\ within a
          system considered at a particular level of analysis''
          \citep{ISO_IEC2023b} and ``the terms module, component, and unit
              [sic] are often used interchangeably or defined to be subelements
          of one another in different ways depending upon the context'' with
          no standardized relationship \citep[p.~82]{IEEE2017}. This means
          unit/component/module testing can refer to the testing of both a
          module and a specific function in a module\seeThesisIssuePar{14}.
          However, ``component'' is sometimes defined differently than
          ``module'': ``components differ from classical modules for being
          re-used in different contexts independently of their development''
          \citep[p.~107]{BaresiAndPezzè2006}, so distinguishing the two
          may be necessary.
    \item % Discrep count (CATS, WRONG): {IEEE2016}
          Since keyword-driven testing can be used for automated \emph{or}
          manual testing \citep[pp.~4,~6]{IEEE2016}, the claim that ``test

          says that reviews are ``\emph{the} process[es] under which static
          white-box testing is performed'' but correctness proofs are given
          as another example by \citet[pp.~418-419]{vanVliet2000}.

          Data-driven testing is categorized as both a test practice
          \citep[p.~22]{IEEE2022} and a test technique
          \citep[p.~43]{Kam2008}\todo{OG Fewster and Graham}.
    \item % Discrep count (DEFS, WRONG): {Kam2008} | ISTQB
          \refHelper \citet[p.~46]{Kam2008}\todo{OG Beizer} says that the goal
          of negative testing is ``showing that a component or system does not
          work'' which is not true; if robustness is an important quality for
          the system, then testing the system ``in a way for which it was not
          intended to be used'' \citepISTQB{} (i.e., negative testing) is one
          way to help test this!

          \refHelper \citet[p.~42]{Kam2008} says ``See \emph{boundary value
              analysis},'' for the glossary entry of ``boundary value testing''
          but does not provide this definition.
