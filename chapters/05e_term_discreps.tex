            The terms ``acceleration'' and ``acoustic tolerance testing'' seem
            to only refer to software testing in \citep[p.~56]{Firesmith2015};
            elsewhere, they seem to refer to testing the acoustic tolerance of
            rats \citep{HolleyEtAl1996} or the acceleration tolerance of
            \accelTolTest{}, which don't exactly seem relevant\dots

            ``Par sheet testing'' from \citepISTQB{} seems to refer to the
            specific example brought up in \hyperref[specificISTQB]
            {this definition discrepancy} and does not seem more widely
            applicable, since a ``PAR sheet'' is ``a list of all the symbols
            on each reel of a slot machine'' \citep{Bluejay2024}.

            ``Hardware-'' and ``human-in-the-loop testing'' have the same
            acronym: ``HIL''\footnote{``HiL'' is used for the former by
                  \citet[p.~2]{PreußeEtAl2012}.} \citep[p.~23]{Firesmith2015}.

            The same is true for ``customer'' and ``contract(ual) acceptance

            \refHelper \citet{Kam2008} misspells ``state-based'' as ``state-base''

            The phrase ``continuous automated testing'' \citep[p.~11]{Gerrard2000a}
            is redundant since continuous testing is a sub-category of automated
            testing (\citealp[p.~35]{IEEE2022}; \citealpISTQB{}).
