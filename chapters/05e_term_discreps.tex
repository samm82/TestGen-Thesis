          The terms ``acceleration tolerance testing'' and ``acoustic tolerance
          testing'' seem to only refer to software testing in
          \citep[p.~56]{Firesmith2015};
          elsewhere, they seem to refer to testing the acoustic tolerance of
          rats \citep{HolleyEtAl1996} or the acceleration tolerance of
          \accelTolTest{}, which don't exactly seem relevant\dots%

          A typo in \citep[Fig.~2]{IEEE2021} means that ``specification-based

          ``structure-based techniques''.

          \refHelper \citet{Kam2008} misspells ``state-based'' as ``state-base''

    \item % Discrep count (TERMS, REDUN): {Gerrard2000a} | {IEEE2022} ISTQB
          The phrase ``continuous automated testing'' \citep[p.~11]{Gerrard2000a}
          is redundant since continuous testing is a sub-category of automated
          testing (\citealp[p.~35]{IEEE2022}; \citealpISTQB{}).
