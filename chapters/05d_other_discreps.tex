\begin{itemize}
      \item \ifnotpaper\else Reference \fi \citeauthor{Kam2008} says that the
            goal of negative testing is ``showing that a component or system
            does not work'' \ifnotpaper\citeyearpar[p.~46]{Kam2008}\todo{OG Beizer}
            \fi which is not true; if robustness is an important quality for
            the system, then testing the system ``in a way for which it was not
            intended to be used'' \citepISTQB{} (i.e., negative testing) is one
            way to help test this! \ifnotpaper
      \item \citeauthor{Gerrard2000b}'s definition for ``security audits''
            seems too specific, only applying to ``the products installed on a
            site'' and ``the known vulnerabilities for those products''
            \citeyearpar[p.~28]{Gerrard2000b}.
      \item \ifnotpaper\else Reference \fi \citeauthor{Gerrard2000a} makes a
            distinction between ``transaction verification'' and ``transaction
            testing'' \ifnotpaper\citeyearpar[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a} \fi and
            uses the phrase ``transaction flows'' \citetext{Fig.~5} but doesn't
            explain them.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Medium Severity}
\begin{itemize}
      \item \citeauthor{Bas2024} lists ``three [backup] location categories:
            local, offsite and cloud based [sic]'' \citeyearpar[p.~16]{Bas2024},
            but does not define or discuss ``offsite backups'' (pp.~16-17).
      \item Availability testing isn't assigned to a test priority
            \citep[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a}, despite the claim that ``the test
            types\gerrardDistinctIEEE{type} have been allocated a slot against
            the four test priorities'' \citetext{p.~13}; I think usability and/or
            performance would have made sense.\fi
      \item ``Visual browser validation'' is described as both static \emph{and}
            dynamic in the same table \citep[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a}, even though
            they are implied to be orthogonal classifications: ``test types can
            be static \emph{or} dynamic'' \citetext{p.~12,~emphasis added}.
            \ifnotpaper
      \item End-to-end functionality testing is \emph{not} indicated to be
            functionality testing \citep[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a}.\fi
\end{itemize}

\ifnotpaper
      \paragraph{Low Severity}
      \begin{itemize}
            \item \citeauthor{DoğanEtAl2014} claim that \citep{SakamotoEtAl2013}
                  defines ``prime path coverage'' \citeyearpar[p.~184]{DoğanEtAl2014},
                  but it doesn't.
            \item ``State-based'' is misspelled by \citeauthor{Kam2008} as
                  ``state-base'' \citeyearpar[pp.~13,~15]{Kam2008} and
                  ``stated-base'' \citetext{Tab.~1}.
            \item \citeauthor{Kam2008}'s definition of ``boundary value testing''
                  says ``See \emph{boundary value analysis},'' but this definition is
                  not present \citeyearpar{Kam2008}.
            \item The phrase ``continuous automated testing''  \citep[p.~11]{Gerrard2000a}
                  is redundant since continuous testing is a sub-category of automated
                  testing (\citealp[p.~35]{IEEE2022}, \citealpISTQB{}).
