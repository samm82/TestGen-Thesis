Sometimes a source cites another for a piece of information that does not
appear! \ifnotpaper The following discrepancies are examples of this:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item % Discrep count (SRCS, WRONG): ISTQB
              The source that \citetISTQB{} cite for the definition of ``test
              type'' does not seem to actually provide a definition.
        \item % Discrep count (SRCS, WRONG): ISTQB
              The same is true for ``visual testing'' \citepISTQB{}.
        \item % Discrep count (SRCS, WRONG): ISTQB
              The same is true for ``security attack'' \citepISTQB{}.
        \item % Discrep count (SRCS, WRONG): {DoğanEtAl2014}
              \else For example, \fi \citet[p.~184]{DoğanEtAl2014}
              \multAuthHelper{claim} that \citet{SakamotoEtAl2013}
              \multAuthHelper{define} ``prime path coverage'', but \ifnotpaper
              they do not. \end{enumerate} \else it does not. \fi
