          Similarly, component testing, integration testing, and component
          integration testing are all listed in \citep{IEEE2017}, but ``component
          integration testing'' is only defined as ``testing of groups of
          related components'' \citep[p.~82]{IEEE2017}; it is a combination of

          The \acs{swebok} V4 defines ``privacy testing'' as testing that
          ``assess[es] the security and privacy of users' personal data to
          prevent local attacks'' \citep[p.~5-10]{SWEBOK2024}; this seems to
          overlap (both in scope and name) with the definition of ``security
          testing'' in \citep[p.~7]{IEEE2022}: testing
          ``conducted to evaluate the degree to which a test item, and
          associated data and information, [sic] are protected so that'' only
          ``authorized persons or systems'' can use them as intended.

          \citeauthor{IEEE2021} define an ``extended entry (decision) table''
          both as a decision table where the ``conditions consist of multiple
          values rather than simple Booleans'' \citeyearpar[p.~18]{IEEE2021}

    \item % Discrep count: ISTQB
          While ergonomics testing is out of scope (as it tests hardware, not
          software), its definition of ``testing to determine whether a
          component or system and its input devices are being used properly
          with correct posture'' \citepISTQB{} seems to focus on how the
          system is \emph{used} as opposed to the system \emph{itself}.

          \citetISTQB{} describe the term ``software in the loop'' as a
          kind of testing, while the source \ifnotpaper they reference \else
              it references \fi seems to describe
          ``Software-in-the-Loop-Simulation'' as a ``simulation environment''
          that may support software integration testing
          \citep[p.~153]{SPICE2022}; is this a testing approach or a tool
          that supports testing?
    \item % Discrep count: {Firesmith2015}
          While model testing is said to test the object under test,
          it seems to describe testing the models themselves
          \citep[p.~20]{Firesmith2015}; using the models to test the object
          under test seems to be called ``driver-based testing''
          \citetext{p.~33}.
    \item % Discrep count: {Firesmith2015}
          Similarly, it is ambiguous whether ``tool/environment testing'' refers
          to testing the tools/environment \emph{themselves} or \emph{using}
          them to test the object under test; the latter is implied, but the
          wording of its subtypes \citep[p.~25]{Firesmith2015} seems to imply
          the former.\fi

          Various sources say that alpha testing is performed by different

          developing the software'' \citep[p.~17]{IEEE2017}, by ``a small,
          selected group of potential users'' \citep[p.~5-8]{SWEBOK2024}, or

          The definition of ``math testing'' given by \citetISTQB{} is

\ifnotpaper
    Also of note: \citep{IEEE2022, IEEE2021}, from the
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 family of standards, mention the following 23 test
    approaches without defining them. This means that out of the 114 test
    approaches they mention, about 20\% have no associated definition!

    However, the previous version of this standard, \citeyearpar{IEEE2013},
    generally explained two, provided references for two, and explicitly defined
    one of these terms, for a total of five definitions that could (should) have
    been included in \citeyearpar{IEEE2022}! These terms have been
    \underline{underlined}\ifnotpaper%
        , \emph{italicized}, and \textbf{bolded}, respectively%
    \fi. Additionally, entries marked with an asterisk* were defined (at least
    partially) in \citeyearpar{IEEE2017}, which would have been available when
    creating this family of standards. These terms bring the total count of terms
    that could (should) have been defined to nine; almost 40\% of undefined test
    approaches could have been defined!
