\chapter{Before Submitting}
\label{chap:before-submitting}

Just before submitting your thesis, you should make sure you've appropriately
configured this template using the \texttt{manifest.tex} file. Specifically, you
should make sure that no errors appear in the \texttt{build/thesis.log} file,
\texttt{make debug} runs without issue, and that your \acs{pdf} is visually
appealing.
