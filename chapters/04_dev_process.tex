\label{chap:development-process}

The following is a rough outline of the steps I have gone through this far for
this project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item start development of system tests (this was pushed too later to focus
          on unit tests)
    \item test inputting default values as \texttt{float}s and \texttt{int}s
    \item check constraints for valid input
    \item check constraints for invalid input
    \item test calculation of:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \texttt{t\_flight}
              \item \texttt{p\_land}
              \item \texttt{d\_offset}
              \item \texttt{s}
          \end{itemize}
    \item test valid output of writing output
    \item test for projectile going long
    \item integrate system tests into existing unit tests
    \item test for assumption violation of g
          \begin{itemize}
              \item code generation could be flawed, so we can't assume
                    assumptions are respected
              \item test cases shouldn't necessarily match what is done by the
                    code; for example, g = 0 shouldn't really give a
                    \texttt{ZeroDivisionError}; it should be a \texttt{ValueError}
          \end{itemize}
    \item test that calculations stop on a constraint violation; this is a
          requirement should be met by the software
    \item test for empty input file
    \item start creation of test summary (for \texttt{InputParameters} module)
          \begin{itemize}
              \item it was difficult to judge test case coverage/quality from
                    the code itself
              \item this is not really a test plan, as it doesn't capture the
                    testing philosophy
              \item rationale for each test explains why it supports coverage
                    and how Drasil derived (would derive) it
          \end{itemize}
    \item start researching testing
    \item noticed that we should capture what should be done when a constraint
          is violated in a reusable way
          \begin{itemize}
              \item have an underutilized method of doing so (see \issueref{3523})
              \item relevant FR is disconnected from code (\issueref{3523}); we've had
                    this issue before (\issueref{3259})
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
