            We want a systematic, rigorous, and ``complete'' taxonomy of
            software testing approaches.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This will help us \textbf{automatically generate test cases}
                      in Drasil \cite{Drasil}, our research framework
                \item We need to \textbf{understand the underlying domain} to
                      determine which kinds of testing can be generated
                      and how to do so (e.g., what knowledge is required?)
            \end{itemize}

            % The first step to any formal process is \textbf{understanding the
            %     underlying domain}. Therefore, a systematic and rigorous
            % understanding of software testing approaches is needed to develop formal
            % tools to test software. In our specific case, our motivation was seeing
            % \textbf{which kinds of testing can be generated automatically by Drasil},
            % ``a framework for generating all of the software artifacts for
            % (well understood) research software'' \cite{Drasil}.

        \begin{block}{\fontsize{37}{20}\selectfont Problem}
            Existing software testing taxonomies are inadequate; for example:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Tebes et al.~(2020) mainly focus on parts of the
                      testing process (e.g., test goal, testable entity)
                \item ROoST, by Souza et al.~(2017), is an ontology, and as
                      such, prioritizes organizing testing approaches over
                      defining them
                \item Unterkalmsteiner et al.~(2014) provide a foundation for
                      classification but not its results
                      %   ``do[] not aim at providing a systematic
                      %   and exhaustive state-of-the-art survey of [either domain]''
                      %   (p.~A:2)
            \end{itemize}
            \vspace{5mm}
        \end{block}

        \begin{block}{\fontsize{37}{20}\selectfont Methodology}
            Since a taxonomy doesn't already exist, we should create one!
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Started from \textbf{established standards and resources},
                      such as IEEE \cite{IEEE2022, IEEE2017, IEEE2013} and
                      the \acf{swebok} \cite{SWEBOK2024}
                \item Relevant information (currently 190 testing approaches,
                      85 software qualities, and their definitions) is then
                      \textbf{collected and organized} into spreadsheets
                \item We will iterate this process until we encounter
                      diminishing returns, implying that something approaching
                      a \textbf{complete taxonomy} has emerged!
                \item Since there are many standardized documents about
                      software testing (or software in general),
                      \textbf{this should be trivial, no?}

                    Information often \emph{appears} logical, but this often
                    breaks down. For example, the classification of test
                    approaches in Figure~\ref{Fig:approach-choices} reveals the
                    following ambiguities:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Experience-based testing is both a test design
                              technique \emph{and} a test practice
                        \item What distinguishes the following pairs is unclear:
                              \begin{itemize}
                                  \item Disaster/recovery testing and recovery

            Despite \cite{IEEE2022} being a software testing standard, it
            leaves much unstandardized (see Figure~\ref{Fig:IEEEdefs}).
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Most (55 out of 99) testing approaches from \cite{IEEE2022}
                      \textbf{do not have a definition}!
                \item Eight of these were (at the very least) described in the
                      previous version of this standard \cite{IEEE2013}
                \item Nine were present in the same way in another IEEE
                      standard \cite{IEEE2017} before this one was published
            \end{itemize}

            This problem extends to definitions of testing
            approaches. For example, the \acs{swebok} V4 says ``scalability testing
            evaluates the capability to use and learn the system and the user
            documentation. It also focuses on the system's effectiveness in
            supporting user tasks and the ability to recover from user errors''
            \cite[p.~5-9]{SWEBOK2024}. This definition seems to be an amalgamation
            of the definitions of usability, recovery, and potentially
            functional testing. What's more, the \acs{swebok}'s definition
            of elasticity testing cites a single source \cite[p.~5-9]{SWEBOK2024}
            \textbf{that doesn't contain the words ``elasticity'' or ``elastic''}!
            \vspace{7mm}\\
            Even when the general idea behind an approach is understood,
            discrepancies can still arise. While alpha testing is quite common
            and understood, there is disagreement on who performs it:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item ``users within the organization developing the software''
                      \cite[p.~17]{IEEE2017},
                \item ``a small, selected group of potential users''
                      \cite[p.~5-8]{SWEBOK2024}, or
                \item ``roles outside the development organization''
                      \cite{ISTQB}.
            \end{enumerate}

        \begin{block}{\fontsize{37}{20}\selectfont Conclusions \& Future Work}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Current software testing taxonomies are \textbf{incomplete,
                          inconsistent, and/or incorrect}
                \item For one to be useful, it needs to be built systematically
                      from a large body of established sources
                \item We will continue investigating how the literature defines
                      and categorizes software testing approaches to analyze any
                      discrepancies and structure these ideas coherently
                \item Hopefully, this leads to a \textbf{centralized, consistent
                          taxonomy} that can grow alongside the literature as the
                      field of testing advances
